= About types of mappings in AtlasMap 

AtlasMap supports the following general types of mappings: 

* *One to one*  — Map one source field to one target field.
* *Many to one*  — Map multiple source fields to to one target field. 
You specify the delimiter character that AtlasMap inserts in the target 
field between the mapped source fields. The default delimiter is a space. 
* *One to many*  — Map one source field to multiple target fields. 
You specify the delimiter character that is in the source field. 
AtlasMap maps each delimited value to a the target field you select.

* *For each* — Iteratively map one source collection field to one 
target collection field.
