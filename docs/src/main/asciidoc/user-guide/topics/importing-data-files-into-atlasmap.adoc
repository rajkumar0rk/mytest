= Importing data files into AtlasMap 

Data mapping allows you to match fields in a source data shape to fields in a 
target data shape. The data shapes that AtlasMap can operate on are 
defined in JSON schema or instance documents, XML schema or instance documents, 
or Java classes. 

To map fields, you import data shape definition files into the AtlasMap 
*Source* and *Target* panels. You can import multiple files into each panel. 
For example, suppose you import three source files and one target file. 
You can map fields from all three source files to the single target file. 

The following topics provide examples of importing different 
data shape definitions:
