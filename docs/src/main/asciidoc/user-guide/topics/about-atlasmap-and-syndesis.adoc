The link:https://www.syndesis.io[Syndesis open-source integration platform] 
embeds AtlasMap. 
In a Syndesis integration, you add connections to applications 
that provide the data of interest to you. With connections in place, 
Syndesis offers an AtlasMap data mapper step. When you add a data mapper 
step, Syndesis displays the data mapper canvas with:

* Source data fields that are provided by previous connections
* Target data fields that are required by the subsequent connection

In other words, you do not import source and target data as you would 
in standalone AtlasMap. Likewise, when data mappings are complete, 
instead of exporting the mappings, you just click a button to indicate 
that you are done. 

When Syndesis embeds AtlasMap, it does not display the icons for 
importing and exporting data.
